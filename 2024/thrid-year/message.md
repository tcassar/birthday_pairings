Greetings + tidings, all



--

Our theme will be in a similar fashion to last year....

There will be **random pairings involved**. You **must cooperate** with this system (DO NOT ASK what the consequences will be).

The process:
  - Tom will use the powers of typey type to randomly pair you with someone
  - The pairs will be sent to the groupchat tomorrow at 10am.
  - Don't worry if you don't know your partner: you can add them off this group chat
  - You will need to organise a **pair costume** around the theme.

The theme is
> Things that GO WELL TOGETHER

For example
- Chips + ketchup
- UoM degree + being unemployed
- 256 and dissapointment

Please let us know if you can't come so we can take you out of Tom's weird computer program, and find you another pair.
