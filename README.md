# Pubcrawl Pairings

## How this works

- You get randomly paired a partner
- You turn up dressed in costume with your partner
- The 2025 theme: **things that go well together**

- For example
    - Salt and Vinegar
    - Ketchup and Mustard
    - 256 and disappointment

## Pairing Results

When the pairs have been allocated, 2025 results will appear here.

## Don't believe its random?

How dare you question my integrity!

Source code publihed in [2025/main.go](https://github.com/tcassar/birthday_pairings/blob/master/2025/main.go) (yes, its `go` this year :))


If you have `go` installed, clone the repo, `cd 2025`, 

```shell
go run main.go ./people.txt  | jq
```

for pretty printed output with jq
